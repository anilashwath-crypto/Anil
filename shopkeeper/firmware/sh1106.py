"""
SH1106 128x64 I2C OLED — the 1.3" panel, not the 0.96".

Two things about this part cost an afternoon on the bench and are encoded here
so they cost nobody else one.

1. COLUMN OFFSET. The SH1106 has 132 columns of RAM behind a 128-pixel panel,
   so the visible window starts at column 2. Driven by an SSD1306 library
   everything sits two pixels left with the wrap showing as a stripe down one
   edge. The 0.96" module IS an SSD1306 and does not want this offset; the 1.3"
   almost always is not.

2. WRITE BEFORE YOU LIGHT IT. Turning the panel on takes the module from about
   0.5 mA to over 20 mA. On a marginal supply it browns out, stops
   acknowledging its own address, and stays dead until the rail is cycled - a
   reset will not clear it, because an ESP32 reset does not drop 3V3. The
   symptom is a screen full of random pixels: the panel lit, then the
   controller fell off the bus before a single byte of frame reached it. So
   show() writes the whole frame with the panel still off and only then sends
   display-on.

   If it dies anyway, the supply is the fault and not this file. Step the
   contrast up while scanning the bus after each step; the level it dies at
   tells you how little headroom there is.

The internal DC-DC command (0xAD 0x8B) is deliberately absent. Modules that
carry their own boost regulator do not want the controller driving one too.
